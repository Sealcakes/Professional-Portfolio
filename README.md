# Professional-Portfolio

## Description

I was presented with a project to create my own professional portfolio website, used to host and display my work over the course of this bootcamp.  I started with researching some popular portfolio website designs and then I modeled mine after one that I like, with some of my own touches on it.  

- I really enjoyed building this project because it is something that I will use going forward with my career.  There will be some edits and changes in the future but I am very proud of my first attempt, I put in a lot of time into making everything work correctly.

- This project solves the issue of how to show off my work to potential employers in the future, it is a way to show what I can do and create.

- I learned a lot and spent a lot of time on it, some of the things I learned was time management (LOL) and I got a lot better at using FlexBox.
